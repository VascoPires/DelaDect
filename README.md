# DelaDect
Delamination and crack detection tool for transparent composite laminates


%%% Crack detection up and maybe one below, or side by side %%%%
%%% Add here a gif with the delamination and crack detection %%%


This is the documentation for how to get started and so on.

For ease of use and in order for the program to be more modular and flexible, the pre-processing of images is done completely outside of the DelaDect, either by using one of the proposed scripts (also found in this repository) or by any other tool chosen by the user. This allows for any minor tweaks or any manual procedures required in the initial images.

Some examples images are provided (already shift corrected), which represent a small portion of the whole test, which can be used for testing purposes of the script. Although the authors obviously recommend a higher number of images for higher accuracy results.

Furthermore, the code does not distinguish between static and cyclic loading, so the output is defined in accordance with the picture ID. This means that the user must correlate the image ID with a given strain value (for static) or cycle number (for fatigue). Some examples are provided in the aux_scripts folder, however the user must ensure the correctness of the data and how it is related with each picture.
