Image Pre-Processing
======================

Image pre-processing is a crucial step for both the crack detection and delamination detection algorithms. In order for the program to work
as expected, namely the edge delamination detection, the specimen must be aligned horizontally in the images. Otherwise, edge delamination
won't be detected properly.
